# Ben-Jammins  
**The beating heart and dirty hands of Ben - the observability engine with teeth.**

This repository contains the **engineering retrospectives**, **deep dives**, and **crate implementations** that form Ben‚Äôs nervous system.  
Think of it as both a **laboratory** and a **ledger**: every subsystem, every choice, every scar gets documented here.

## Purpose

**Ben-Jammins** is where code meets reflection.  
Each crate in this workspace corresponds to a major subsystem in Ben, and the accompanying `retros/` and `deepdives/` directories provide context and commentary:
- `retros/` ‚Üí design decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned during implementation.
- `deepdives/` ‚Üí long-form technical breakdowns of specific mechanisms (ClickHouse pipelines, control-plane signing, etc.).

This structure lets Substack hold the architectural overviews and philosophy,  
while `ben-jammins` holds the schematics, experiments, and hard-earned understanding.

## üß© Crates Overview

### `bee`
The **bridge daemon** responsible for secure socket hand-offs between Ben and external agents.  
Implements the encrypted handshakes, message verification, and ephemeral key lifecycle.  
Think of it as Ben‚Äôs diplomatic envoy - trusted but cautious.

### `bee-keeper`
The **controller** and certificate authority for Bee nodes.  
Manages registration, revocation, and policy enforcement across distributed sidecars.  
Keeps the swarm in formation.

###  `ben_crypto`
All **cryptographic primitives** used throughout Ben.  
Implements ed25519 signing, hashing functions, and envelope encryption utilities.  
This crate is deliberately minimal, auditable, and dependency-light.

###  `ben_dsl`
Defines Ben‚Äôs **domain-specific language** for telemetry lanes (diag, event, control).  
Contains the macro parser, grammar definitions, and compile-time validators that let users describe telemetry contracts declaratively.

###  `ben_fuzz`
Houses fuzz tests, random input generators, and chaos simulations for every public interface.  
Ensures Ben‚Äôs logic fails *predictably* under unpredictable conditions.

###  `ben_macros`
All procedural and derive macros for Ben‚Äôs meta-programming layer.  
Used for schema derivation, telemetry lane registration, and DSL code generation.  
This crate embodies the ‚Äúbuild systems that think‚Äù philosophy.

###  `ben_policy`
The policy engine - a declarative rules layer defining what Ben is allowed to do.  
Includes enforcement logic for thresholds, rate limits, and ethical boundaries.

###  `ben_db`
The database examinations - stored procs. things I do with ClickHouse

###  `ben-detectors`
Implements Ben‚Äôs **statistical and ML anomaly detectors**.  
Contains algorithms like EWMA, CUSUM, streaming PCA, and learning-based drift detection.  
Each detector adheres to a common trait interface for easy registration.

###  `ben-nli`
Natural Language Interpretation module.  
Translates telemetry and incident reports into plain human language.  
Drives Ben‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrative reports‚Äù that summarize system health for operators.

###  `ben-orchestrator`
Coordinates Ben‚Äôs internal modules - acts as a central scheduler and router for telemetry events.  
Implements load balancing, dispatch strategies, and recovery behaviors.

###  `ben-scrub`
(Formerly *Ben-Sanitizer*)  
Handles **data redaction, PII detection, and field-level masking.**  
Operates as both a library (for SDK use) and a daemon (for pipeline sanitation).  
Its job: clean the signals, not the meaning.

###  `ben-spine`
The **ingestion backbone** - a gRPC streaming service for all telemetry.  
Validates incoming records, enforces schema contracts, and writes to ClickHouse.  
Every heartbeat of the ecosystem flows through the Spine.


it won't always be a 1 to 1 explanation as I gotta keep some of my secrets.
